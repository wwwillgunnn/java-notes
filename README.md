// Stack trees // 
depth first search --> uses a stack 
stack is a list based data structure where you can only add or pop from the end Last In First Out
  - often done using recursion

bredth first search --> uses a queue 
queue is First In First Out, pop from the beginning 

// Graphs //
Adjacency list 
Adjacency matrix 

find the smallest degree of separation !
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
- Topological sort

// Hash maps //
THE HOLY GRAIL
- A data structure built on top of an array optimised to store key value pairs
- O(1) cost to delete, insert and store  data
- like dictionary in python
